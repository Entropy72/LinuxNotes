SSH

•HOW TO ACCESS A REMOTE HOST WITH PRIVATE KEYS

  - this can be used to avoid typing in the password of the other machine every time


  - make a public-private keypair using 
  
    • ssh-keygen
    - keypair is stored in the home folder in the .ssh hidden folder
    -

  - move the public key to the remote server so it recognizes the private key on connection
  
    • ssh-copy-id <user@machine> 


  - known_hosts file - stores details and pubkeys of all the hosts that your system has connected to.
  - authorized_keys file - stores the pubkey of all systems that can connect using private keys
  - config file - is the local user config file that overrides system defaults


• SYSTEM WIDE CONFIG FILES 

  - in /etc/ssh:
                - ssh_config - system wide ssh client settings
                - sshd_config - system wide ssh host (daemon) settings. only there if ssh server is installed.



• SSH-AGENT
  
  - ssh-agent is a ssh utility used to repeatedly connect to remote machine without putting in the passphrase for your 
   private key. (if you have set up keypairs and it put a password on your private key)  
  - it does this by storing your private key open in memory
 
 • How To Set Up SSH-AGENT
  
   - run ssh-agent and run it's output (the output when run, adds the environmental variables needed)
   - or run `eval `ssh-agent``, (eval automatically runs the output of a command)
  

  - then run ssh-add
  - ssh-add is used to open your private key in memory. It adds the default private key. 


  - `ssh-agent -k` is used to kill the ssh-agent program

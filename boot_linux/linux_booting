bios is the firmware in the ROM, BIOS is the actual things. Terminolgy used here. Probably incorrect as only BIOS exists

1.BIOS/UEFI
2.POST
3.Bootloader
4.Kernel + initrd
5.Root file system - all files in /
6.systemd - the first process
*simplified model



•BIOS/UEFI - the first thing the motherboard goes to when turned on. (The ROM)
•POST - the Power On Self Check - runs on startup to check for basic device health. The BIOS/UEFI starts this.


•Bootloader - the bootloader (ex. grub2,Windows boot loader) is stored on the HDD. Used by UEFI/BIOS to load the OS.

   
   •BIOS - only a single bootloader can be stored in the MBR - the first HDD sector (512 KB)
         - you can boot multiple OSs from a single HDD with BIOS using a bootloader like GRUB. Ex..
         - A dual boot linux + windows would work with a single GRUB bootloader which would chainload the extra windows 
           bootloader stored in the windows partition (not MBR)*
        
	 - This is a unique case and the previous OS's bootloader is deleted by the next installed OS for BIOS systems.


   •UEFI - bootloader is stored in the ESP (EFI system partition - existing in all systems with a UEFI bios).
           
	    - UEFI allows the user to choose which bootloader to use in the UEFI manager (the bios thingy). 
            - Mulitple ESPs or multiple bootloaders in a single ESP allow booting multiple OSs from the same hard drive. 
              (As different OSs may need different bootloaders ex. Ubuntu and Windows)  
            
	    - Stored in a GPT (GUID Partition Table).

            - In UEFI the path to the bootloader is stored in ROM, leading to the actual bootloader, which links to a 
              OS. Writing the bootloader path to ROM is done by the OS at installation. **


            

•Chainloading - the process that occurs when a bootloader loads another bootloader which may finally boot the OS.
              
   EX.        - this occurs in UEFI when GRUB is the main bootloader and the user chooses windows as the OS so grub 
                launches the windows boot loader. 
              
              - in BIOS chainloading also occurs. See BIOS* in bootloader  
              
              - this is not chainloading - where you live boot into a linux system with a broken bootloader. The live 
                boot usb loads its GRUB bootloader which allows the choice of OS through its menu. So the live GRUB 
                bootloader boots the linux on the system if you choose it. 1 bootloader only is used. Liveboots do not 
                alwsys use GRUB as it maybe overly complex for loading just an ISO.
              
              - Ventoy allows for multiple OSs on a single pendrive. It shows a menu which allows you to choose which OS
                to boot. It only displays the menu and then chainloads the ISO using the ISO's own (not necessarily GRUB                ) bootloader. 
              
              - When using Ventoy for the first time on the system, it must write it's path to the UEFI. see UEFI**

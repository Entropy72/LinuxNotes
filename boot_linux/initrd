•INTRO

  •The bootloader only boots the kernel and initrd; and not the entire system

  •initrd or initramfs are used to mount the filesystem and get the system up, it loads all necessary drivers

   •The disk image (initrd) or the cpio archive (initramfs) is specified in the grub menu entry.
   •The file path is specified and is usually the path `/boot/initrd.imgblablabla` for both initrd and initramfs
   
   •Most OSs refer to initramfs (almost always used) as initrd.

•SET UP

initrd - a special block device (/dev/ram) that is mounted as the initial root file system
       - it loads the initrd file into RAM and runs the commands to mount the actual root and filesystem
       - the kernel must have a driver for initrd filesystem
       - the initrd file is usually a disk image (ex. iso)
       - the driver for the initrd disk image file system is necessary to load the initrd.


initramfs - usually a cpio archive (compressed file type (eg. zip, tar))
	  - the initrd file is loaded into RAM by grub (grub menu entry need initrd path) and uncompressed by the kernel
	  - it loads the initrd file into RAM and runs the commands to mount the actual root and filesystem
	  - it is an archive and not a block devices so it doesn't need an driver to understand the initrd filesystem.


•COMMANDS

  •mkinitrd - prev - used to make initrd
            - now - calls dracut and makes initramfs 

  •dracut - a tool used to build an initramfs archive
          - dracut <initrd> <kernel version>     
          - parameters not necessary, unless a initramfs for a non default file path name and kernel version is needed.

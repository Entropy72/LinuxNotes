PROCESS STATES

there are a few states a process that is displayed in ps can be in. 
(if a process isnt displayed on ps or top, it is dead, fully and totally dead)


• running - this is your active normal process 
          - symbolised by R



• stopped - this is when a process is paused 
          - a truly dead or killed process wont have a pid or be shown on ps
            stopped is not dead
          - represented by T
 
         

• sleeping (int) - this is when a process isn't actively doing anything at that moment and is just waiting for a command
                 - if you open vim and leave it, or if you start a sleep timer that is a sleeping process waiting 
		   for an action
                 - this is the most common state
                 - int means interruptable and it can be killed or activated
                 - symbolized by T



• sleeping (unint) - when a process puts all it's resources into smth it is failing at (eg getting enough disk IO), 
                     it can do into this state
		   - since it is using all it's resources it does not put resources into listening to you
                   - unint means uninterruptable, means it does not respond to kill signals and cannot be killed
		   - you'll need to wait for it to succeed at the problem or reboot to kill the process
                   - represented by D


• zombie process - when a parent process leaves it's child's pid and doesnt remove it after the child process has ended.
                 - so the child process is technincally dead and over but it's pid is still there bc the parent hasn't 
		   removed it
                 - you cant kill it cuz there is no process to kill (kill sigs end the process not remove the pid)
                 - can only be ended by killing the parent process or sending a `SIGCHILD` signal to the parents 
		   (doesnt usually work)
		 - represented by Z

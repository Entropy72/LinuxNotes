FIND PROCESS ID


• pidof
         - finds the pid of a running process

      Usage:
                - `pidof <process_name>`
                - needs an exact match, or nothing will be returned



• pgrep

        - same as pidof, tho like pkill it doesnt need exact match



• lsof

        - list open files
        - lots of stuff
        - ports are files 
       
  
     Flag: 
            - `lsof -u <user>` - shows process for that user
            - `lsof -i` - shows open ports
 

       

• ps 

       - used to show the list of running processes at that point in time
       - it shows pid, cpu usage, ram and stuff
       - sorts by process id
     
     Flag:
	    - `ps aux` or `ps -ef` - commonly used standards to view the running task
	    - `-l` - to see nice value            




• top

       - used to show list of running process live 
       - shows nice value under NI
     
       
       - sorts by CPU usage
       - can use < or > to change what it sorts by 
       - use Ctrl + R to reverse sort order


       Flags: 
              `-p <PID>` - shows the details for that process only 


• htop

       - a better top
       - shows uptime, threads, graphs, and everything top does 
       - let's you use mouse TO SORT WOOHOO
       - you can kill process directly from htop. woohoo



SETTING PRIORITIES

  What Is Nice Level?

      - a nice level is the priority level of a process
      - determines it's right to system resources and cpu cycles
      - it ranges from -19 to 19, with -19 the highest priority and 19 being the lowest

      - the default nice level for a process is 0


• nice

      - used to START a process with a specific nice level


      Usage:
	     `nice -n <nice value> <process to run>`

      Flags:
    	     `-n` - is used to specify a nice value
                  - it doesnt have to be done. eg -10 sets a nice value of 10. it is confusing without -n so use it
                 


• renice


     - used to CHANGE the nice level of a RUNNNING process
     - as a running process will already have a nice value
     - no process can be given a higher nice value unless you have root priviledges


     Usage: 
	    `renice -n <nice value> <PID>`

ENCRYPTED PARTITION


â€¢ cryptsetup 
  
          - this is the command to setup and manage encrypted partitions (has support for BitLocker and stuff)
          - it is often used for LUKS encryption setup or plain dm-crypt encrytion 

	  - the partition is encrypted using a passphrase and can only be accessed if the passphrase is given
          - possible to use keys instead (you could store them on a seperate usb stick maybe)

          - to access the partition you need to open it, whether for read or write
          - the partition is now visible in /dev/mapper/<name>
          - you can now mount it and it install a file system on it

	  - close the device when you are done with it
          - to open the device means everything is in RAM, so on shutdown, luks is automatically closed 
             

        
     LUKS - Linux Unified Keys Setup 
          - it has metadata headers that is visible and could be damaged but it has more features than dm-crypt

    
      Usage 

            to create:
            - cryptsetup <format> <partition>
            - sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1

            to open:
            - cryptsetup open <partition> <name>
            - the name is what you see the partition as for the time it is open
  
	    to close:
            - cryptsetup close <name>
        
          
  
    Automatically mount on boot

            - to have the encrypted partition automatically mount on boot you need to:
 	      1. open the disk
                    - create /etc/crypttab
 		    - make an entry for the disk:
                           - <name> <UUID="uuid"> <-> 
		           - the third field can be used to specify the keys so it can auto decrypt on boot. 
                           - the `-` makes it ask the user for a passphrase during boot
              
	      2. mount it
                    - make an entry in etc/fstab
 		    - check out ./mounting file for more details

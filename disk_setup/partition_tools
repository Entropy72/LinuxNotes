PARTITION TOOLS

CHECK OUT THE disk_setup FILE AS WELL


• HOW TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT PARTITIONS

  • blkid - is used to find the UUID, fs
          - needs root permissions

  • lsscsi - is used to list the storage devices (regardless if they are scsi or not)
           
  • lsblk - lists block devices (files) and partitions as well
          - lists file system for each partition
          - includes loop files for snaps as well as partitions bc both are block 
          - `lsblk | grep -v loop` - might help





 • partprobe - inform the OS of partition table changes
             - used when changes are made to the partition table (eg. using gdisk or parted)

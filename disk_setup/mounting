HOW TO MOUNT A FILE SYSTEM 


after partitioning and installing a filesystem
mounting a partition makes it accessible to the user from the point it is mounted on

aka you can access the entire partition from where it has been mounted
you can only mount by partitions and not drives (unless you using lvm)


    -    `lsblk` - prior to mounting (with -f flag, displays UUID)
    -    `df -h` - after mounting (shows mountpoint too)


• mount - used to manually mount drives
   
   Usage: `mount <device> <path/to/mountpoint>`
        : `mount /dev/sdb /mnt`



• FUSE - file system in user space
       - doesn't need root permissions



• umount - used to unmount drives 
        
     Usage: `umount <device>`
            `umount /dev/sdb`



FSTAB


• etc/fstab - entries in the fstab file will be automatically mounted at boot
            - what is mounted as the root (/) partition is specified here
	    - you need to have root access to edit the file

    
	Usage: entries to the fstab file should be made in the order (written in the fstab in shorthand too)

              <device> <mountpoint> <file_system type> <options (can say defauts)> <dump*> <fs_check**>

              device - can be either UUID, path to device or device label
                     - UUID is generated from the file system, and PARTUUID is generated from the partition

              dump* - an outdated tool used to back up the partition
  		    - set to 0 to disable

              fs_check** - enables fs_check to be automatically periodically run on the partition
			 - 0 - to disable that option
                         - 1 - to enable it (and it's the root partition)
                         - 2 - to enable it on a non root partition
                         - this just allows fs check to be possible and doesn't actually do it

              mount -a   - this mounts all the files specified in mount, without having to restart the device. 
                           used to test if the mount is working and still have access to the system.


SYSTEMD MOUNTS

• systemd.mount

    - systemd creates systemd.mount files that actually do the mounting after reading the fstab
    - you can create them manually but it's recommended (and easier) to just edit fstab


    - these .mount files are generated on boot in the /run/systemd/generator/ folder
    
    - to make a systemd .mount file directly :
         
         - go to /etc/systemd/system/ - where user generated files systemd files should be made 
           (unless you are making them in your home dir `~/.config/systemd/user`)
         
         - create a file (name should follow rules to work)
           name is based on the mountpoint (eg /mnt/drive3  ->  mnt-drive3.mount)

DOUBLE MOUNTS

   
    - you can mount the same partition on different mount points and access them easily
    - you can mount different partitions on the same mount point and would only have access to the latest one, however 
      when that is unmounted you regain access to the older mounted partition

WHAT IS A DESKTOP ENTRY?


• A desktop entry is a file that is usually created by gui applications to run them from a shortcut or from search. aka you need this to run your program
 from the gui.

  - they are stored in either:

                • ~/.local/share/applications/   - for user specific desktop entries. has greater priority over the /usr ones
		• /usr/share/applications/  - for global desktop entries

  
  - they are named:

                • with a .desktop extension
		• ex. [appname].desktop, discord-canary.desktop

 
   - they specified like this:

             •  [Desktop Entry]
		Name=MyApp
		Comment=This is my application
		Exec=/path/to/your/script.sh
		Icon=/path/to/icon.png
		Terminal=false
      	       	Type=Application
		Categories=Utility;                  - used to sort applications the gui. 


           
   - to run them:

		• make the .desktop file a executable

                • update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/   -or specify other location. refreshes the known list of desktop entries

                • you can just log in and log out to refresh as well

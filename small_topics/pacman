pacman is the main package manager for arch linux. it is used in conjuction to the official arch repostories. (and doesnt work with AUR, you need yay for that.)

how does pacman work:


pacman has a main catergory of upper case flags, and lower case flags.
the lower case flags can sometimes act as a data filter to enter parameters into the main upper case command.


 update system:

       sudo pacman -Syu


   -y  - this flag updates the local repostories (excluding AUR ones)
   -S  - sync. depends on the other sub flags
   -u  - makes -S only update the installed, outdated packages.

   ...descriptions of these are dubious. -Syu is commonly used to update the system.


 search system or repos:

       pacman -Qs "package"  - searches the downloaded packages
       pacman -Ss "regex"    - searches the names and descriptions of the packages in the repos.


   -Q  - querys the database of the packages installed on the system.
   -s  - search


 installing packages:

       sudo pacman -S "package"


  removing a package:

       sudo pacman -Rns "package_name"

  -R   - remove a package
  -n   - like .rpmsave, pacman saves the oldconfig file by default. can clog up the system.
  -s   - removes only the dependencies that arent being used by other packages.



yay does this but also includes AUR repos. very similar flags too.

  -Sua   - to update only AUR repos


- add these notes to the github
- .rpmsave files has some misinfo
- restore the swap files if needed

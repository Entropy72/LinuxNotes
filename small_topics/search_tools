SEARCHING FOR FILES



• locate - searches a database of files /var/lib/locate/locate.db
         - searched by file name 
         - `-r` flag to use with regex          

         - the database needs to be kept updated

               • updatedb - needs to be run to update the database
                          - updatedb is usually run daily from a systemd.timer(8).

         -  tends to be faster than find as it searches the database and not the entire filesystem
         -  locate tends to be used as its variants mlocate and plocate most of the time



• find - searches the filesystem for specified parameters.
       
   Usage:

       - find <search place> <flags> <search expression>

       - find / -type f -name "*itro*"     - searches in root. for a file. that has `itro` in it's name.
                                           - if no search place is set then, pwd is starting search place


   Flags:

       - `exec command {} +` - executes the command on all the found files. {} is a placeholder for the file name. + is 
                               for termination.
       - `-E` - extended regex

     
   Filters:

      - `-name` - name of files. case sensitive. `-iname` for case insensitive
      - `-type` - files or directories (type f or type d)
      
      - `-mmin -10 -mmin +5` - files modified in the last 10 min. and files modified before 5m ago.
      - `-mtime` - same as mmin but in days
      - `-amin` `-cmin` - for access and changed time is also there

      - `-size +5M` - files bigger than 5M
      - `-empty` - for empty files 
      - `-perm  777` - files with permissions 777
      - `maxdepth 1` - only searches down present directory and not deeper


• grep - can be used to search the contents of files

   Usage: 
    
        grep -rnw <starting directory> -e <pattern> 

   Flags: 

        -r: Recursively search subdirectories.

        -n: Display line numbers for matched content.

        -w: Match the whole word (optional, depending on your search needs).

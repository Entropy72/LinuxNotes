• du - shows the storage of individual files and folders
     - shows the disk used by all files and folders recursively from pwd (unless flags or args are specified)
      

    Usage:

                - `summarize` - doesn't display file sizes recursively 
                              - and only shows the size of pwd (if no arguments specified) or args

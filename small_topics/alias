HOW TO MAKE AN ALIAS

 There are temporary alias that work for only that shell session and persisten ones specificied in ~/.bashrc.
   
   • To view all aliases:

          - alias

   • For a temporary alias:

          -  alias <new_alias>=<command>

   • For a permanant alias like i think you care about:

           - echo "alias <new_alias>='<command>'" >> ~./.bashrc
           - add the same command to the bashrc file so that it is in effect on every session.
            
           - source ~./.bashrc
           - refreshes the bashrc file


   • To remove an alias:

          - unalias <alias>    - works only in that shell session
          - delete it from the ~./.bashrc.


You can specify an alias in /etc/bash.bashrc instead to ensure that the alias works across different user shells.

Kernel panic usually occurs when:

a process changing run-levels* 
missing or corrupted drivers
a hardware issue
software changes (ex. kernel without necessary modules (eg drivers))

This is equivalent to a BSOD in windows.
It prevents booting of the machine

*A run level is the complexity level at which a machine is running
ex. single user mode (no networking)
    multiuser mode (+- networking)
    recovery mode 
    graphical 
    shutdown or reboot

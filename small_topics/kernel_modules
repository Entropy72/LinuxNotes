MANAGING KERNEL MODULES	


â€¢ the linux kernel has a modular structure. so that for each machine and use case we can add or remove exactly what 
  base functionality that we need.

â€¢ modules are often things like file system drivers and other drivers.ðŸ’€     


â€¢ lsmod - lists out all the currently loaded modules (from the /proc folder)

â€¢ rmmod <module name> - unloads a module from running 

â€¢ insmod <module path> - inserts a unloaded module into the running state. they usually live in the /usr/lib/modules/ 
                         subfolders.

â€¢ modprobe <module name> - inserts an unloaded module into the running state, without need to know the whole path. 
                         - it also loads all the necessary dependancy modules that this module needs to load succesfully

â€¢ modinfo <module name> - shows information about that module (description, author, alias, dependencies)

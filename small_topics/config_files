CONFIG FILES

most config files are stored in either /etc or in the /home/user

Running processes can be made aware of changes to their configuration files using the `systemctl reload <programname>`
command.



â€¢WHAT ARE .RPMNEW OR .RPMSAVE FILES?


In RHEL based distros if you have already made a config file for a program 
or an old config file from a previously installed version of the program is present

and you install the program, the new default configuration files that comes with the program will be saved in the normal
place and have a `.rpmnew` extension

however if there are new changes in the newly installed config file compared to your copy, you will have the option to 
replace your copy with the new default config 

and your copy will be saved in the same folder with a `.rpmsave` file extension.



It's main purpose is to allow you to have a fallback option. The .rpmnew or .rpmsave files are usually deleted later


.rpmnew  - newly installed config, that's being used

.rpmsave  - previously installed config, that is not being used




ARCH LINUX 

Arch also has this feature with .pacsave files storing the old config, unless the -n (no save) is used with -R.

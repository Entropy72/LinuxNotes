DNS TOOLS 



• resolvectl - a systemd commands used to see some dns information

	Subcommands:
                     - `status` - shows the IP of the DNS servers that the system queries (from the /etc/resolv.conf)
		     - it is the default subcommand of resolvectl


		     - `flush-caches` - a subcommand to clear cache of previous resolved domain names
                     - this ensures that the dns or files are queried instead of the checking the cache 
 

		     - `query <domain name>` - displays dns records (like dig)



• hostnamectl - shows the information abt the system
              - hostname, OS ver, kernel ver, hardware model
              - what the fuck
	      - a systemd thing
	      - you can change the hostname (`hostnamectl hostname <new_host_name>`)



• hostname - displays just the hostname

HOW TO READ INFORMATION ON YOUR DNS


• dig   - displays DNS entries
	- finds out the IP address of a given domain by looking through sources
        - looks in cache first tho (resolvectl flush-caches to clear the cache)
	- same format as actual name records

  
      Flags:
             - `-x` - the dash x flag does a reverse lookup (finding domain name from IP address)



• resolvectl query - a subcommand of resolvectl 
                  



• nslookup - name server lookup
	   - does reverse lookups automatically (without flag)

	Flags: 
		`-type=<record type>` - used to find specific dns records (other than A records)
				      - mx is for mail exchanger and cname for aliases 



• host - same as above lol
       - short and sweet, IPv4, IPv6 and mail exchange record and done


	Flags:
		- '-v' - verbose, lots of junk data


• WHOIS - query registars for contact information of a the owner of a domain
        - shows the address, phone number and other stuff of the domain owner

	- ppl often use a proxy to put their information instead and as such the owner's real info isnt there
